## Day 2: Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Computer Vision

In this hands-on course, you will learn the basics of deep learning by training and deploying neural networks. You will

* implement common deep learning workflows such as Image Classification and Object Detection,
* experiment with data, training parameters, network structure, and other strategies to increase performance and capability, and
* deploy your networks to start solving real-world problems.

On completion of this course, you will be able to start solving your own problems with deep learning.
